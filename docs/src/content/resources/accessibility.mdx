This website is committed to accessibility and strives to provide an inclusive experience for all users. All core content and navigation are designed to be accessible. The site follows the WCAG 2.2 AA standard.

## What users can expect

You should be able to:

- Zoom up to 300 % without loss of content or functionality. Zooming beyond 300 % may work but is not guaranteed.  
- Navigate the website using a keyboard alone.  
- Access content using screen readers such as NVDA and VoiceOver. Other screen readers (JAWS or TalkBack) are not explicitly tested.
