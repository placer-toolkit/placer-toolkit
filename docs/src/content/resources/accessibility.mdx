## What users can expect

You should be able to:

- Zoom up to 300 % without loss of content or functionality. Zooming beyond 300 % may work but is not guaranteed.
- Navigate the website using a keyboard alone.
- Access content using screen readers such as NVDA and VoiceOver. Other screen readers (JAWS or TalkBack) are not explicitly tested.
