## Discussions

GitHub provides repositories the ability to enable Discussions and is enabled on the Placer Toolkit repository. It’s open to anyone with a GitHub account and is the best place to:

- Ask for help
- Share ideas and receive feedback
- Show the community what you’re working on
- And learn more about the project, its values and its roadmap

## Where are the other social platforms?

Many social media platforms are not fully GDPR‐compliant. To protect the privacy of our users—especially for those in the EU—Placer Toolkit does not maintain any official social media accounts outside of the Discussions panel on our GitHub repository. We prefer to keep all communication transparent and privacy‐friendly.
