title: Accessibility
description: This is the accessibility statement for the Placer Toolkit website and its components. We strive to make our website usable by everyone.
---

This website is committed to accessibility and strives to provide an inclusive experience for all users. All core content and navigation are designed to be accessible. The site mostly follows the WCAG 2.2 AA standard.

## What users can expect

You should be able to:
 
- Zoom up to 300 % without loss of content or functionality. Zooming beyond 300 % may work but is not guaranteed.
- Navigate the website using a keyboard alone.
- Access most content using screen readers such as NVDA and VoiceOver. Other screen readers (JAWS or TalkBack) are not explicitly tested.

## Feedback

If you encounter accessibility barriers, you can provide feedback via [GitHub Issues (recommended)](https://github.com/placer-toolkit/placer-toolkit/issues) if you have an account; otherwise, you can e‐mail us at [placer.coc.reports+accessibility@gmail.com](mailto:placer.coc.reports+accessibility@gmail.com).

We aim to respond to accessibility feedback within one week.
