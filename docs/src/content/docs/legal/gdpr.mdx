title: Privacy and GDPR
description: The GDPR is an EU regulation that applies to virtually every website. Placer Toolkit is built with privacy in mind and aims to protect your personal data.

The [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://gdpr.eu) is an EU regulation that applies to websites whose owner is based in the EU or processes personal data of an EU resident. It was designed to protect user privacy and reshape how companies and organisations handle personal data.

## Does it apply to me?

If you’re using Placer Toolkit or even owning a website at all, it almost certainly applies to you because of how large the EU population actually is. And geoblocking EU users to avoid GDPR won’t work too as you’re processing their personal data to _block_ them from your site.

We’ve been GDPR‐compliant since 31 October 2025 and provide appropriate guidance for you to comply with the GDPR.

## Data processors

We ourselves aren’t data processors. Placer Toolkit is a client‐side library, meaning we don’t host your data or run our own CDN. We rely on established platforms like Vercel, jsDelivr and Tally to handle the heavy lifting of hosting and community moderation. Therefore, we don’t need to provide a <abbr title="Data Processing Agreement">DPA</abbr>.

## How we handle your data

We don’t track you, use cookies or violate your privacy in any way.

- **Tracking:** We don’t use any privacy‐intrusive analytics or services to track you, such as Google Analytics, social media pixels, etc.
- **Cookies:** No cookies are used on our site (for your sanity).
- **Hosting:** Our site is hosted on Vercel. Unlike other open‐source projects, we take proper precautions and such as necessary by GDPR to remain GDPR‐compliant.

For a deeper dive into this topic, you can read our [privacy policy](/docs/legal/privacy). (Don’t worry, it’s not legalese!)

## Questions

Under the GDPR, you have the right to access, rectify or delete any personal data. Since we aim to store no personal data about you, fulfilling these requests is simple: There is usually nothing to delete.
