Placer Toolkit is an open‐source project, and we welcome contributions from everyone. When you join our community, you’ll find a friendly group of enthusiasts at all experience levels, ready to chat about anything and everything related to Placer Toolkit.

The easiest way to start contributing is to join the [discussion forum](https://github.com/placer-toolkit/placer-toolkit/discussions). This is where you can discuss new ideas, ask for feedback and more!

A common misconception about contributing to an open‐source project is that you need to know how to code. This simply isn’t true. In fact, there are _many_ ways to contribute, and some of the most important contributions come from those who never write a single line of code. Here’s a list of ways you can make a meaningful contribution to the project:

- Submitting well‐written bug reports.
- Submitting feature requests that are within the scope of the project.
- Improving the documentation.
- Responding to users that need help in the [discussion forum](https://github.com/placer-toolkit/placer-toolkit/discussions).
- Triaging issues on GitHub.
- Being a developer advocate for the project.
- Sponsoring the project financially.
- Sharing ideas.
- Fixing violations of the [Placer Style Guide](https://github.com/placer-toolkit/placer-style-guide).
- And of course, contributing code.

Please take a moment to review these guidelines to make the contribution process as easy as possible for both yourself and the project’s maintainers.

## Using the issue tracker

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/placer-toolkit/placer-toolkit/issues) is for bug reports, feature requests and pull requests exclusively. We want you to follow these guidelines when using the issue tracker.

- Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests. Use the [discussion forum](https://github.com/placer-toolkit/placer-toolkit/discussions/categories/help) instead.
- Please **do not** derail, hijack or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and be respectful of others.
- Please **do not** post comments with **+1** or **👍**, as that will spam the comments section with irrelevant comments. Use [reactions](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments) instead.
- But **do** use the issue tracker for bug reports, feature requests and pull requests.

Issues that do not follow these guidelines are subject to closure. There simply aren’t enough resources for the author and contributors to troubleshoot personal support requests.

### Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable_ problem caused by code in the library. Bug reports are an important contribution to the quality of the project. When submitting a bug report, there are a few steps you can take to make sure your issues get attention quickly.

- Please **do not** paste in large blocks of irrelevant code.
- But **do** search for an existing issue before creating a new one.
- Also explain the bug clearly.
- And **always** add a minimal sandbox that demonstrates the bug, like CodePen or JSFiddle.
- To replicate the bug, **do** provide additional information when necessary.

A minimal test sandbox is critical to a successful bug report. It demonstrates that the bug exists in the library and not in surrounding code. Contributors should be able to understand the bug without studying your code, otherwise, they’ll probably move on to another bug.

### Feature requests

Feature requests can be added using the [discussion forum](https://github.com/placer-toolkit/placer-toolkit/discussions/categories/ideas).

- Please **do** search for an existing request before suggesting a new feature.
- But also use the voting buttons to vote for a feature.
- Also share substantial use cases and perspective that support new features if they haven’t already been mentioned.
- And as always, **never** bump, spam or ping contributors to prioritise your own feature.

### Pull requests

To keep the project on track, please consider the following guidelines before submitting a PR.

- Please **do not** submit a PR if you don’t create a new branch for that feature. It will mess up the commit history for the next PR.
- But **do** make sure your PR clearly defines what you’re changing. Even if you feel your changes are obvious, please explain them so other contributors can more easily review your works. PRs without detailed descriptions are subject to closure pending more details.
- Also open your PR against the `main` branch.
- **Never** edit anything in **`cdn`** and **`dist`** folders. These files are generated automatically, so you **must** edit the source files instead.

The maintainer reserves the right to reject any PR that’s outside the scope of the project or doesn’t meet code quality standards.

### Branches

Placer Toolkit has three main branches used for different purposes.

- `main`: This branch reflects ongoing development in Placer Toolkit. All PRs must be submitted to this branch. Any changes made in this branch can be previewed in [preview-placer-toolkit.vercel.app](https://preview-placer-toolkit.vercel.app).
- `1.0-deploy`: This branch reflects the latest Placer Toolkit v1 release and powers [placer-toolkit.vercel.app](https://placer-toolkit.vercel.app).
- `pre-1.0-deploy`: This branch contains a historical archive of Placer Toolkit v0.5.1. You can find the historical snapshot on [v0-placer-toolkit.vercel.app](https://v0-placer-toolkit.vercel.app).

## Developing

To set up a local development environment, [fork the repo](https://github.com/placer-toolkit/placer-toolkit/fork) on GitHub or clone it locally. Then, you can install its dependencies.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/placer-toolkit/placer-toolkit
cd placer-toolkit # Navigates into your clone
npm install # Installs dependencies for Placer Toolkit
cd docs
npm install # Installs dependencies for Placer Toolkit’s docs
```

Once you’ve cloned the repo, you can run the following command to spin up the development server for the docs. Make sure you’re in the `docs` folder of the project.

```shell
npm run dev # Spins up the dev server provided by Astro
npx astro dev --host # If you want to expose the server on your network
```

This will spin up the dev server on `localhost:4321`. There isn’t any hot module reloading as Web Components aren’t compatible with this technology, but it’ll automatically refresh the page instead.

### Creating new components

To properly scaffold a new component, you must follow a series of steps. Due to the complexity of the documentation structure, these instructions are intended to guide you through the process and ensure your component is integrated correctly.

The first step is to create the component files. Inside the `src/docs/components` directory, create a new folder named after your component using kebab‐case. Within this folder, you must create three essential files: a main entry file, a component logic file and a CSS file. Remember to add JSDoc to your component code to ensure that API documentation tables can be auto‐generated properly. Refer to existing components to maintain consistent coding conventions.

Once the files are created, you must add the component export to the codebase. Open `src/placer.ts` and add an export for the new component under the **Components** section. It is essential to ensure that the new entry is alphabetically sorted to maintain order.

```diff
 export { default as PcCheckbox } from "./docs/components/checkbox/checkbox.js";
 export { default as PcColorPicker } from "./docs/components/color-picker/color-picker.js";
 export { default as PcComparer } from "./docs/components/comparer/comparer.js";
+export { default as PcComponentName } from "./docs/components/component-name/component-name.js";
 export { default as PcCopyButton } from "./docs/components/copy-button/copy-button.js";
 export { default as PcDetails } from "./docs/components/details/details.js";
 export { default as PcDialog } from "./docs/components/dialog/dialog.js";
```

Finally, you can proceed with documenting the component. Create a new MDX file for your component in `docs/src/content/docs/components` and adding a link to the component in both `docs/src/docs/layouts/Sidebar.astro` and `docs/src/docs/layouts/MobileSidebar.astro`, again, ensuring the entries are alphabetically sorted.

Following these steps will ensure your new component is properly integrated and its documentation is consistent with the rest of the project.

## Documentation

Maintaining good documentation can be a painstaking task, but poor documentation leads to frustration and makes the project less appealing to users. Fortunately, writing documentation for Placer Toolkit is fast and easy!

Most of Placer Toolkit’s technical documentation is generated with JSDoc comments and TypeScript metadata from the source code. Every property, method, event and other stuff is documented this way. In‐code comments encourage contributors to keep the documentation up to date as changes occur so the docs are less likely to become stale. Refer to an existing component’s code to see how JSDoc comments are used in Placer Toolkit.

Instructions, code examples and interactive demos are hand‐curated to give users the best possible experience. Typically, the most relevant information is shown first and less common examples are shown towards the bottom. Edge cases and gotchas should be called out in context with tips or warnings.

The docs are powered by [Astro](https://astro.build). Check out the `docs/src/content/docs/components/*.mdx` to get an idea of how pages are structured and formatted. If you’re creating a new component, it may help to use an existing component’s MDX file as a template.

If you need help with documentation, feel free to reach out in the [discussion forum](https://github.com/placer-toolkit/placer-toolkit/discussions/categories/help).

We also have a style guide called [Placer Style Guide](https://github.com/placer-toolkit/placer-style-guide) and it must be followed up to the expectations listed in [PLACER_STYLE_GUIDE_VIOLATIONS.md](https://github.com/placer-toolkit/placer-toolkit/blob/main/PLACER_STYLE_GUIDE_VIOLATION.md).


### GitHub-flavored Markdown

The Placer Toolkit documentation uses MDX with the [`@astrojs/mdx`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx) integration. With this integration, it automatically converts straight to smart quotes with [SmartyPants](https://github.com/silvenon/remark-smartypants) and other stuff. It supports standard Markdown from the [GFM spec](https://github.github.com/gfm) as well as JSX expressions.

#### Code blocks

For code blocks, use the fenced code block syntax. Do not use the indented code block syntax, as that looks weird in the code, does not support syntax highlighting and also does not use the correct code block styling.

#### Code demos

Code demos are used to show demonstrations of different states of a component. To add one, use the fenced code block syntax with the language set to `demo`. All code demos must use HTML, no other language is accepted. JavaScript and CSS can be embedded in the code demo with `<script>` and `<style>` tags.

````jsx
```demo
<!-- insert your HTML code here… -->
```
````

You can also append attributes to expand the code by default or remove the CodePen button. The order of these attributes don’t matter.

````jsx
```demo:no-codepen:open
<!-- insert your HTML code here… -->
```
````

#### Callouts

Callouts can be added using the [Callout](/docs/components/callout) component. Refer to its docs to add it into the MDX file.

#### Details

To provide additional details that can be expanded or collapsed, use the [Details](/docs/components/details) component.

```html
<pc-details summary="Details title">
    These details can be shown or hidden!
</pc-details>
```

#### Auto‐keyboard switcher

To switch from <kbd aria-label="Control">Ctrl</kbd> and <kbd aria-label="Command">⌘</kbd> depending on which operating system you’re on, import the Astro component from the MDX file.

```mdx
{/* The import path may be different depending on where the MDX file is located. */}
import AutoKeyboardSwitch from "../../docs/components/AutoKeyboardSwitch.astro";
```

Then, insert the component in your MDX file like this.

```mdx
<AutoKeyboardSwitch keyName="ctrl" />
```

It would map to the correct symbol depending on the operating system you’re on.

There are many keys that can be remapped. Here’s a list of all the available key names you can use on this component.

- `meta`
- `ctrl`
- `command` (alias of `ctrl`)
- `enter`
- `alt`
- `altgr`
- `shift`
- `tab`
- `delete`

#### GitHub issues

To link to a GitHub issue, PR or discussion, you can use this custom Markdown syntax. Make sure to replace `#167` with the correct issue, PR or discussion number.

```markdown
[github#167]
```

### Localisation

We currently support two languages in the Placer Toolkit docs: English (en) and Deutsch (de). If you plan to help us translate some pages, check out the Placer Style Guide for the respective languages you want to translate:

- [Deutsch (de)](https://github.com/placer-toolkit/placer-style-guide/tree/2.x/translations/de/README.de.md)

In the future, we will create a glossary for programming terms so you can translate the pages consistently.

## Best practices

The following is an exhaustive list of conventions, patterns and best practices we try to follow. As a contributor, we ask you make a good faith effort to follow them as well. This ensures consistency and maintainability throughout the project.

If in doubt, use your best judgement and the maintainers will be happy to guide you during the code review process.

<pc-callout appearance="primary">
    <pc-icon
        library="default"
        icon-style="solid"
        name="lightbulb"
        slot="icon"
    ></pc-icon>
    This section can be a lot to digest in one sitting, so don’t feel like you need to take it all in right now. Most contributors will be better off skimming this section and reviewing the relevant content as needed.
</pc-callout>

### Accessibility

Placer Toolkit is built with accessibility in mind. Creating generic components that are fully accessible to users with varying capabilities across a multitude of circumstances is a daunting challenge. Oftentimes, the solution to an accessibility problem is not written in black and white, and therefore, we may not get it right the first time around. There are, however, guidelines we can follow in our effort to make Placer Toolkit an accessible foundation from which applications and websites can be built.

We take this commitment seriously, so please ensure your contributions have this goal in mind. If you need help with anything accessibility‐related, please reach out to the community for assistance. If you discover an accessibility concern within the library, please file a bug on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/placer-toolkit/placer-toolkit/issues).

It’s important to remember that, although accessibility starts with foundational components, it doesn’t end with them. It’s everyone’s responsibility to encourage best practices and ensure we’re providing an optimal experience for all of our users.

### Code formatting

Most code formatting is handled by [Prettier](https://prettier.io) via commit hooks. However, for the best experience, you should [install it in your editor](https://prettier.io/docs/editors) and enable **Format on Save**.

Please do not make any changes to `.prettierrc` without consulting the maintainers.

### Language

In Placer Toolkit, we consistently follow the [Placer Style Guide](https://github.com/placer-toolkit/placer-style-guide) and use British English. We kindly ask that contributors follow the same guidelines when contributing to the project.

### Composability

Components should be composable, meaning you can easily reuse them with and within other components. This reduces the overall size of the library, expedites feature development and maintains a consistent user experience.

### Component structure

All components have a host element, which is a reference to the `pc-*` element itself. Make sure to always set the host element’s `display` property to the appropriate value depending on your needs, as the default is `inline` per the custom element spec.

```css
:host {
    display: block;
}
```

Aside from `display`, avoid setting styles on the host element when possible. The reason for this is that styles applied to the host element are not encapsulated. Instead, create a base element that wraps the component’s internals and style that instead.

When authoring components, please try to follow the same structure and conventions found in other components. Classes, for example, generally follow this structure.

1. Static properties/methods
2. Private/public properties (that are _not_ reactive)
3. `@query` decorators
4. `@state` decorators
5. `@property` decorators
6. Lifecycle methods (`connectedCallback()`, `disconnectedCallback()`, `firstUpdated()`, etc.)
7. Private methods
8. `@watch` decorators
9. Public methods
10. The `render()` method

Please avoid using the `public` keyword for class fields. It’s simply too verbose when combined with decorators, property names and arguments. However, _please do_ add `private` in front of any property or method that is intended to be private.

<pc-callout appearance="primary">
    <pc-icon
        library="default"
        icon-style="solid"
        name="handshake"
        slot="icon"
    ></pc-icon>
    This might seem like a lot, but it’s fairly intuitive once you start working with the library. However, don’t let this structure prevent you from submitting a PR. Code can change and nobody will chastise you for “getting it wrong”. At the same time, encouraging consistency helps keep the library maintainable and easy for others to understand.
</pc-callout>

### Class names

All components use a [shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM), so styles are completely encapsulated from the rest of the document. As a result, class names used _inside_ a component won’t conflict with class names _outside_ the component, so we’re free to name them anything we want.

### Boolean properties

Boolean properties should _always_ default to `false`, otherwise, there’s no way for the user to unset them using only attributes. To keep the API as friendly and consistent as possible, use a property such as `noHeader` and a corresponding kebab‐case attribute such as `no-header`.

When naming boolean properties that hide or disable things, prefix them with `no-`, e.g., `no-spin-buttons` and avoid using other verbs such as `hide-` or `disable-` for consistency.

### Conditional slots

When a component relies on the presence of slotted content to do something, don’t assume its initial state is permanent. Slotted content can be added or removed any time and components must be aware of this. A good practice to manage this is:

- Adding `@slotchange=${this.handleSlotChange}` to the slots you want to watch.
- Add a `handleSlotChange` method and use the `hasSlot` utility to update state variables for the respective slot(s).
- Never conditionally render `<slot>` elements in a component—always use `hidden` so the slot remains in the DOM and the `slotchange` event can be captured.

See the source of the Card, Dialog and Drawer components for examples.

### Dynamic slot names and expand/collapse icons

A pattern has been established in `<pc-details>` and the upcoming `<pc-tree-item>` components for expand/collapse icons that animate on open/close. In short, create two slots called `expand-icon` and `collapse-icon` and render them both in the DOM, using CSS to show/hide only one based on the current open state. Avoid conditionally rendering them. Also avoid using dynamic slot names, such as `<slot name=${open ? "open" : "closed"}>`, because Firefox will not animate them.

There should be a container element immediately surrounding both slots. The container should be animated with CSS by default and it should have a part so the user can override the animation or disable it. Please refer to the source and documentation for the Details component for examples.

### Fallback content in slots

When providing content inside of `<slot>` elements, avoid adding parts.

```html
<!-- ❌ Don’t do this -->
<slot name="icon">
    <pc-icon part="close-icon"></pc-icon>
</slot>
```

This creates confusion because the part will be documented, but it won’t work when the user slots in their own content. The recommended way to customise this example is for the user to slot in their own content an target its styles with CSS as needed.

### Custom events

Components must only emit custom events, and all custom events must start with `pc-` as a namespace. For compatibility with frameworks that utilise DOM templates, custom events must have lowercase, kebab‐case names. For example, use `pc-change` instead of `pcChange`.

This convention avoids the problem of browsers lowercasing attributes, causing some frameworks to be unable to listen to them. This problem isn’t specific to one framework, but [Vue’s documentation](https://vuejs.org/guide/docs/components/events) provides a good explanation of the problem.

### Change events

When change events are emitted by Placer Toolkit components, they should be named `pc-change` and they should only be emitted as as result of user input. Programmatic changes, such as setting `element.value = "…"` _should not_ result in a change event being emitted. This is consistent with how native form controls work.

### CSS custom properties

To expose custom properties as part of a component’s API, scope them to the `:host` block.

```css
:host {
    --background-color: var(--pc-color-primary-fill-loud);
    --color: var(--pc-color-primary-on-loud);
}
```

Then use the following syntax for comments so they appear in the auto‐generated API tables. Do not use the `--pc-` prefix, as that is reserved for design tokens that live in the global scope.

```typescript
/**
 * @cssproperty --background-color: var(--pc-color-primary-fill-loud) - The component’s background colour.
 * @cssproperty --color: var(--pc-color-primary-on-loud) - The component’s text colour.
 */
@customElement("pc-example")
export class PcExample extends PlacerElement {
    // …
}
```

### Focusing on disabled items

When an item focusable with keyboard navigation is disabled (e.g., tabs, trees, menu items, etc.), the disabled item _should not_ receive focus via keyboard, clicks or taps. It should be skipped just like in operating system menus and in native HTML form controls. There is no exception to this. If a particular item requires focus for assistive devices to provide a good user experience, the item should not be disabled and, upon activation, it should inform the user why the respective action cannot be completed.

### Properties vs CSS custom properties

When designing a component’s API, standard properties are generally used to change the behaviour of a component, whereas CSS custom properties (“CSS variables”) are use to change the appearance of a component. Remember that properties can’t respond to media queries, but custom properties can.

There are some exceptions to this (e.g., when it significantly improves DX), but a good rule of thumbs is, “Will this need to change based on screen size?” If so, you probably want to use a CSS custom property.

### CSS custom properties vs CSS parts

There are two ways to customise components: With CSS custom properties (“CSS variables”) or CSS parts (“parts”).

CSS custom properties are scoped to the host element and can be reused throughout the component. A good example of a custom property would be `--border-width`, which might get reused throughout a component to ensure borders share the same width for all internal elements.

CSS parts let you target a specific element inside the component’s shadow DOM, but by design, you can’t target a path’s children or siblings. You can _only_ customise the part itself. Use a part when you need to allow a single element inside the component to accept styles.

This convention can be relaxed when following it strictly would reduce developer experience.

### Naming CSS parts

While CSS parts can virtually be named anything, within Placer Toolkit, they must use the kebab‐case convention and lowercase letters.

When composing elements, use `part` to export the host element and `exportparts` to export its parts.

```typescript
@customElement("pc-example")
export class PcExample extends PlacerElement {
    // …

    render() {
        return html`
            <div part="base">
                <pc-icon
                    part="icon"
                    <!-- other attributes… -->
                    exportparts="base:icon-base"
                ></pc-icon>
            </div>
        `;
    }
}
```

This results in a consistent, easy to understand structure for parts. In this example, the `icon` part will target the host element and the `icon-base` part will target the icon’s `base` part.

### Dependencies

TL;DR: A component counts as a dependency only when it’s rendered inside another component’s shadow root.

Many components within Placer Toolkit depend on others internally. For example, `<pc-dialog>` uses `<pc-button>` for the close button in the dialog panel. Since this component appears in the button’s shadow root, they are considered dependencies of Dialog. Since dependencies are automatically loaded, users only need to import Dialog and everything will work as expected.

Contrast this to `<pc-select>` and `<pc-option>`. At first, one might assume that Option is a dependency of Select. After all, you can’t really use Select without slotting in at least one Option. However, Option _is not_ a dependency of Select! The reason is because no Option is rendered in the Select’s shadow root. Since the options are provided by the user, it’s up to them to import both components independently.

Some may suggest, that Placer Toolkit should auto‐load Select and Option, Tab Group, Tab and Tab Panel, etc. Although some components are designed to work together, they’re technically not dependencies so eagerly loading them may not be desirable. What if someone wants to roll in their own component with a superset of features? They wouldn’t be able to if Placer Toolkit automatically imported it!

For non‐dependencies, _the user_ should decide what gets registered, even if it comes with a minor inconvenience.

### Form controls

Form controls should support submission and validation through the following conventions:

- All form controls must use `name`, `value` and `disabled` properties in the same manner as `HTMLInputElement`.
- All form controls must have a `setCustomValidity()` method so the user can set a custom validation message.
- All form controls must have a `reportValidity()` method that report their validity during form submission.
- All form controls must have an `invalid` property that reflects their validity.
- All form controls should mirror their native validation attributes such as `required`, `pattern`, `minlength`, `maxlength`, etc. when possible.
- All form controls must be tested to work with the standard `<form>` element.

### System icons

Avoid inlining SVG icons inside of templates. If a component requires an icon, make sure `<pc-icon>` is a dependency of the component and use the system library.

```html
<pc-icon library="system" icon-style="…" name="…"></pc-icon>
```

This will render the icons instantly whereas the default library would fetch them from a remote source. If an icon isn’t available in the system library, you will need to add it to `library.system.ts`. Using the system library ensures that all icons load instantly and are customisable by users who wish to provide a custom resolver for the system library.
