**Effective date:** 31 October 2025

_This policy is provided in a concise, transparent and easily accessible form using clear and plain language, in accordance with [GDPR Article 12](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-12-gdpr). For the official, legally binding version of this policy, please view [Appendix A](/legal/privacy/appendix-a)._

## Your privacy is important to us

We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This privacy policy explains what limited data we collect, how it’s used and your rights and choices.

## Our data practices

### No personal data collected by us

Except for data voluntarily submitted for [Code of Conduct reports](#code-of-conduct-violation-reports), we do not directly collect or process any personal data that could identify you (such as your name or e‐mail address). The only personal data involved is the IP address that is automatically transferred to third‐party services (like our content delivery networks) for the sole technical purpose of delivering content, as detailed below. This technical transmission is necessary for the website to function, and the legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interest in delivering content efficiently and ensuring network security.

### No cookies used

This website does not use cookies.

### Third‐party content delivery networks

We use content delivery networks (CDNs) to load resources efficiently. When you visit our website or use Placer Toolkit, your browser may make requests to these services.

#### Netlify

This website’s content is hosted and delivered using Netlify (a U.S.‐based content delivery network). When you access the site, your browser sends your IP address to Netlify for the sole technical purpose of delivering the website files and ensuring security. Netlify processes this data in logs for a limited time for operational and security reasons. Netlify’s privacy practices can be found at [https://netlify.com/privacy](https://netlify.com/privacy).

#### jsDelivr

We use jsDelivr (a UK‐based service) to host Placer Toolkit, some Fontsource fonts and Font Awesome Free icons. When your browser loads these resources, jsDelivr may receive your IP address as part of the normal technical process of delivering content. jsDelivr’s privacy practices can be found at [https://www.jsdelivr.com/terms/privacy-policy](https://www.jsdelivr.com/terms/privacy-policy).

#### Bunny Fonts

We use Bunny Fonts (an EU‐based, privacy‐first service) to load some of the fonts on this website. When your browser requests a font file, your IP address is sent to the Bunny Fonts server for the sole technical purpose of delivering the content. Bunny Fonts has a strict zero‐logging and no‐tracking policy, meaning the IP address received is not stored or processed for any other purpose. Bunny Fonts is operated by BunnyWay d.o.o. in the EU.

#### Font Awesome Kits (optional)

If you configure Placer Toolkit to use Font Awesome Pro or Font Awesome Pro+, your browser will load icons from Font Awesome’s Kit CDN instead. When this happens, your IP address is sent to Font Awesome’s servers to count pageviews for that Kit. IP addresses are considered personal information under GDPR. This only applies if you actively choose to use a paid Font Awesome plan—the default configuration uses Font Awesome Free via jsDelivr and does not send your IP address to Font Awesome. If you use Font Awesome Pro or Pro+, you are also subject to Font Awesome’s Privacy Policy at [https://fontawesome.com/privacy](https://fontawesome.com/privacy).

### Code of Conduct violation reports

We are committed to maintaining a safe and respectful community. If you submit a report of a Code of Conduct violation, we process the data submitted to investigate and enforce our community guidelines. This processing is based on our legitimate interest in community safety and security, and the necessity of processing for the establishment or defence of legal claims, as CoC reports may contain sensitive personal data.

**Data processed:**

When a report is submitted via the official report form, the following information is collected by our data processor, Tally, on our behalf:

- **Identifying information:** Contact details of the reporter (if provided, you may choose to submit anonymously) and identifiers (e.g., username, account ID) of the individual(s) being reported.
- **Incident details:** Text, time stamps and any attached screenshots describing the alleged violation. This data may contain sensitive personal data (special category data).

**Safeguards:**

This data is stored under strict confidentiality, with access limited only to the essential team members required for investigation. We retain this data only for as long as necessary to complete the investigation and enforce remedial action. Tally acts as a data processor for these reports, and we maintain a mandatory DPA with them.

### Use of local storage

We use your web browser’s [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) to save your website preferences. This is non‐personal data that is stored on your own device and is not sent to our servers. This data may include your choice of light/dark mode and the open/closed state of sidebar sections. This helps us remember your preferences so you don’t have to set them again on each visit.

### Privacy‐first analytics

To understand how our website is used and to improve it, we use [Cabin Analytics](https://withcabin.com), a privacy‐first analytics tool that is compliant with GDPR and other privacy laws. You can read their privacy policy at [https://docs.withcabin.com/privacy](https://docs.withcabin.com/privacy). This tool collects anonymised, non‐personal data such as:

- The number of page views.
- The referral source that brought you to the site.
- The type of device and browser you are using.

This data is not linked to any individual user and is used in an aggregated form to analyse trends, not to track you personally.

## Your data rights

As we do not process personal data directly, the scope of these rights is limited to the data processed by our third‐party providers. However, under the GDPR, you have the following rights, and you may contact us to exercise them:

- **Right to access:** To receive confirmation of whether personal data concerning you is being processed.
- **Right to rectification:** To have inaccurate personal data corrected.
- **Right to erasure (“Right to be forgotten”):** To have your personal data deleted, where applicable.
- **Right to object** or **restrict processing** (where applicable).

You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the e‐mail provided below.

## Policy information

### Compliance with data protection laws

We operate in full compliance with the GDPR and other applicable data protection laws. Placer Toolkit is the data controller responsible for deciding how data is processed. Our third‐party service providers act as data processors on our behalf and process data according to our instructions: Netlify (hosting), Tally (Code of Conduct reports) and jsDelivr (static asset delivery). We maintain mandatory DPAs with each of these providers. Other external services are not considered data processors for the purposes of this policy.

For transfers of personal data (such as IP addresses) to our U.S.‐based service provider, Netlify, we rely on their adherence to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (DPF), which ensures an adequate level of data protection for data received from the EU and UK.

For transfers of personal data (such as IP addresses) to our U.S.‐based providers, Netlify relies on both the EU–U.S. Data Privacy Framework (DPF) and Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), while jsDelivr relies on SCCs to ensure an adequate level of protection for data received from the EU and UK.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will post any changes on this page and update the “Effective date”.
