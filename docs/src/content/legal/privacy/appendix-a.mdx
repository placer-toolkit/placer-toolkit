**Effective date:** 31 October 2025

_For a simpler, more user‐friendly explanation, please return to our main Privacy Policy [here](/legal/privacy)._

## Preamble

This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) sets forth the data processing practices of this website (the “Website”) and serves to inform users regarding the collection, use and protection of their data. Use of the Website constitutes acknowledgment and acceptance of the data processing practices described herein. This Policy has been drafted to be fully compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and other applicable data protection laws.

## Data processing activities

### Non‐collection of personal data

The Website does not, as a matter of policy and technical implementation, directly collect or process any personally identifiable information (PII) or personal data, as defined by GDPR, except for data voluntarily submitted for [Code of Conduct reports](#code-of-conduct-violation-reports). Such data may include, without limitation, identifiers such as names, e‐mail addresses and telephone numbers. No data controller–data subject relationship is established solely by user interaction with the Website. However, certain third‐party services utilised by the Website may receive technical data, including IP addresses, as described in the [Third‐party content delivery networks](#thirdparty-content-delivery-networks) section below.

### Use of cookies

The Website does not utilise cookies.

### Third‐party content delivery networks

The Website and associated software library (“Placer Toolkit”) utilise third‐party content delivery networks (CDNs) for the efficient distribution of static resources. Access to the Website or implementation of Placer Toolkit necessitates that the user’s browser establish connections with the following third‐party services, which may result in the transmission of technical data as inherent to the HTTP protocol.

#### Netlify CDN (hosting and content delivery)

The Website’s content is hosted and delivered by Netlify, Inc., a U.S.‑based entity. As a necessary function of the HTTP/HTTPS protocol, the user’s browser transmits its IP address to Netlify’s servers for the technical purposes of routing requests, content delivery, and ensuring platform security and operational logging. Netlify, Inc. acts as a data processor in relation to this data. The Website operator relies upon Netlify’s adherence to both the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (DPF) and Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) to ensure an adequate level of protection for the international transfer of personal data in compliance with Chapter V of the GDPR and the applicable UK data protection regime. The privacy policy of Netlify, Inc. is accessible at [https://netlify.com/privacy](https://netlify.com/privacy).

#### jsDelivr CDN

The Website employs jsDelivr, operated by Volentio JSD Limited, a company registered in England and Wales, for the hosting and delivery of Placer Toolkit library files, Fontsource font resources and Font Awesome Free icon resources. In the course of retrieving such resources, the user’s browser transmits an IP address to jsDelivr’s servers as a necessary technical requirement of content delivery via the HTTP/HTTPS protocol. jsDelivr is subject to both the UK GDPR and EU GDPR with respect to personal data processed within their respective jurisdictions. The Website operator relies upon jsDelivr’s public Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, as well as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), to satisfy the requirements of GDPR Article 28(3) and ensure adequate protection for international transfers of personal data. The privacy policy of jsDelivr is accessible at [https://www.jsdelivr.com/terms/privacy-policy](https://www.jsdelivr.com/terms/privacy-policy).

#### Bunny Fonts

The Website employs Bunny Fonts, operated by BunnyWay d.o.o., an EU‐based entity, for the delivery of web fonts. As an inherent technical requirement of the HTTP/HTTPS protocol, the user’s browser transmits an IP address to Bunny Fonts’ servers for the sole purpose of content delivery. The Website operator relies upon the processor’s public commitment to its strict zero‐logging and no‐tracking policy to assert that the transmitted IP address is not stored or processed in a manner that constitutes personal data processing beyond what is strictly necessary for the performance of the requested service.

#### Font Awesome Kit CDN (optional configuration)

Placer Toolkit provides optional support for Font Awesome Pro and Font Awesome Pro+ icon libraries through user‐initiated configuration. Should a user elect to configure Placer Toolkit to utilise a Font Awesome Pro or Pro+ subscription via a Kit code, icon resources shall be retrieved from Font Awesome’s Kit CDN rather than jsDelivr. Under this configuration, the user’s IP address is transmitted to Fonticons, Inc.’s servers for the purpose of pageview enumeration associated with the authenticated Kit. IP addresses constitute personal data as defined under GDPR Article 4(1).

The foregoing configuration shall not be enabled by default; requires affirmative initiation by the implementing party; and is optional, with default operation utilising Font Awesome Free via jsDelivr, which does not constitute processing of personal data by Fonticons, Inc.

**Notice to implementers:** Parties who elect to configure Placer Toolkit to utilise Font Awesome Pro or Pro+ services shall assume the role of data controller with respect to the personal data processed thereby. Such parties bear sole responsibility for:

<ol type="i">
    <li>
        Ensuring compliance with all applicable data protection laws, including but not limited to GDPR;
    </li>
    <li>
        Providing appropriate disclosures in their own privacy policies;
    </li>
    <li>
        Establishing a lawful basis for processing under GDPR Article 6(1); and
    </li>
    <li>
        Fulfilling all obligations imposed upon data controllers under applicable law.
    </li>
</ol>

The privacy policy of Fonticons, Inc. is accessible at [https://fontawesome.com/privacy](https://fontawesome.com/privacy). Implementation of Font Awesome Pro or Pro+ features subjects the implementing party to Font Awesome’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

### Code of Conduct violation reports

To maintain a safe and respectful community, the Website operator processes data submitted voluntarily for Code of Conduct (CoC) violation reports.

| Data processing activity | Lawful basis (Art. 6)                                          | Special category basis (Art. 9)                                                      | Data processor |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------- |
| CoC report processing    | Legitimate interest: Community safety, security and integrity. | Necessity for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims (Art. 9(2)(f)). | Tally          |

**Data processed:**

- **Identifying information:** Contact details of the reporter (if provided) and identifiers of the reported individual(s) (e.g., username, account ID).
- **Incident details:** Textual data, time stamps and any attached screenshots describing the alleged violation, which may contain sensitive personal data (special category data).

**Safeguards:**

The processing relies on strict data minimisation and confidentiality measures. Access to reports is strictly limited to essential team members required for investigation. The data is retained only for the duration necessary to complete the investigation and enforce remedial action. The Website operator maintains a mandatory Data Processing Agreement (DPA) with Tally.

### Local storage implementation

The Website utilises the browser’s `localStorage` API for the sole purpose of storing user‐specific preferences on the client‐side device. This data is exclusively non‐personal and is not transmitted to our servers. Such data may encompass configuration settings, such as theme preferences (e.g., light/dark mode) and the state of user interface elements (e.g., sidebar visibility), and are retained only for client‐side persistence of configuration parameters, without constituting personal data processing.

### Third‐party analytics

For the purpose of website performance monitoring and optimisation, the Website employs Cabin Analytics. The service processes exclusively anonymised and aggregated technical data and does not constitute processing of personal data. The data collected includes, but is not limited to, page view counts, referral sources and general device/browser information. This data is processed in a manner that precludes the identification of data subjects and is not linked to any individual user. The Website operator relies on the processor’s policy and technical implementation of anonymisation by design to classify this activity as non‐personal data processing. The privacy policy of Cabin Analytics is accessible at [https://docs.withcabin.com/privacy](https://docs.withcabin.com/privacy).

## Legal provisions

### Compliance with GDPR

The processing activities described herein are conducted in strict accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Regulation (EU) 2016/679, and other applicable data protection laws. Placer Toolkit shall act as the data controller, determining the purposes and means of any personal data processing.

| Data controller status                 | Data processor relationships                                                                                                                                  |
| :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Placer Toolkit is the data controller. | A mandatory Data Processing Agreement (DPA) is maintained with Netlify, Inc., in relation to hosting and content delivery.                                    |
|                                        | A mandatory DPA is maintained with jsDelivr for minimal technical processing of personal data (IP addresses) inherent to content delivery.                    |
|                                        | A mandatory DPA is maintained with Tally for the processing of Code of Conduct (CoC) reports.                                                                 |
|                                        | Other third‐party service providers, including Bunny Fonts and Cabin Analytics, are generally not considered data processors for the purposes of this Policy. |


### International data transfers

The processing of technical data, specifically IP addresses, involves transfers to processors located in the United States of America, notably Netlify, Inc. As a legal basis for these transfers of personal data from the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK) to a U.S.‐based processor, the Website operator relies on the processor’s adherence to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (DPF). This framework ensures an adequate level of data protection in compliance with Chapter V of the GDPR and the applicable UK data protection regime.

Certain technical data, including IP addresses, may be transferred to processors located outside the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK), notably to Netlify, Inc., a U.S.‐based entity. The Website operator relies upon Netlify, Inc.’s adherence to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (DPF) and, where applicable, Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) to provide an adequate level of protection for such personal data, in compliance with Chapter V of the GDPR and the UK data protection regime.

### Policy amendments

This Policy may be amended from time to time. Any such modifications shall be posted on this page, and the “Effective date” will be updated accordingly. Continued use of the Website subsequent to any amendment constitutes acceptance of the amended Policy.
