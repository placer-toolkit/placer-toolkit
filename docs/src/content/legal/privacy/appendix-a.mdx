**Effective date:** 31 October 2025

_For a simpler, more user‐friendly explanation, please return to our main Privacy Policy [here](/legal/privacy)._

## Preamble

This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) sets forth the data processing practices of this website (the “Website”) and serves to inform users regarding the collection, use and protection of their data. By accessing and using the Website, you acknowledge that you have been informed of the practices described herein. This Policy has been drafted to be fully compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and other applicable data protection laws.

## Data processing activities

### Non‐collection of personal data

The Website does not, as a matter of policy and technical implementation, directly collect or process any personally identifiable information (PII) or personal data, as defined by GDPR, except for data voluntarily submitted for [Code of Conduct reports](#code-of-conduct-violation-reports). This includes, but is not limited to, names, e‐mail addresses and telephone numbers. No data controller–data subject relationship, as defined by GDPR, is established by virtue of a user’s direct interaction with the Website. However, certain third‐party services utilised by the Website may receive technical data, including IP addresses, as described in the [Third‐party content delivery networks](#thirdparty-content-delivery-networks) section below.

### Use of cookies

The Website does not utilise cookies.

### Third‐party content delivery networks

The Website and associated software library (“Placer Toolkit”) utilise third‐party content delivery networks (CDNs) for the efficient distribution of static resources. Access to the Website or implementation of Placer Toolkit necessitates that the user’s browser establish connections with the following third‐party services, which may result in the transmission of technical data as inherent to the HTTP protocol.

#### Netlify CDN (hosting and content delivery)

The Website’s content is hosted and delivered by Netlify, Inc. (a U.S.‐based entity). As a necessary function of the HTTP/HTTPS protocol, the user’s browser transmits its IP address to Netlify’s servers for the technical purpose of routing requests, content delivery and ensuring platform security and operational logging. Netlify, Inc. acts as a processor with respect to this data. The privacy policy of Netlify, Inc. is accessible at [https://netlify.com/privacy](https://netlify.com/privacy).

#### jsDelivr CDN

The Website employs jsDelivr, operated by Volentio JSD Limited, a company registered in England and Wales, for the hosting and delivery of Placer Toolkit library files and Font Awesome Free icon resources. In the course of retrieving such resources, the user’s browser transmits an IP address to jsDelivr’s servers as a necessary technical requirement of content delivery via the HTTP/HTTPS protocol. jsDelivr is subject to both the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR) with respect to personal data processed within their respective jurisdictions. The Website operator relies upon the public Terms of Service and Privacy Policy of jsDelivr to fulfill the requirements of Article 28(3) of the GDPR with respect to the minimal, technical processing of IP address data inherent to content delivery. The privacy policy of jsDelivr is accessible at [https://www.jsdelivr.com/terms/privacy-policy](https://www.jsdelivr.com/terms/privacy-policy).

#### Bunny Fonts

The Website employs Bunny Fonts, operated by BunnyWay d.o.o., an EU‐based entity, for the delivery of web fonts. As an inherent technical requirement of the HTTP/HTTPS protocol, the user’s browser transmits an IP address to Bunny Fonts’ servers for the sole purpose of content delivery. The Website operator relies upon the processor’s public commitment to its strict zero‐logging and no‐tracking policy to assert that the transmitted IP address is not stored or processed in a manner that constitutes personal data processing beyond what is strictly necessary for the performance of the requested service.

#### Font Awesome Kit CDN (optional configuration)

Placer Toolkit provides optional support for Font Awesome Pro and Font Awesome Pro+ icon libraries through user‐initiated configuration. Should a user elect to configure Placer Toolkit to utilise a Font Awesome Pro or Pro+ subscription via a Kit code, icon resources shall be retrieved from Font Awesome’s Kit CDN rather than jsDelivr. Under this configuration, the user’s IP address is transmitted to Fonticons, Inc.’s servers for the purpose of pageview enumeration associated with the authenticated Kit. IP addresses constitute personal data as defined under GDPR Article 4(1).

This configuration option is:

<ol type="a">
    <li>Not enabled by default;</li>
    <li>Requires affirmative action by the implementing party; and</li>
    <li>
        Is entirely optional, with the default configuration utilising Font Awesome Free via jsDelivr, which does not transmit IP addresses to Fonticons, Inc.
    </li>
</ol>

**Notice to implementers:** Parties who elect to configure Placer Toolkit to utilise Font Awesome Pro or Pro+ services shall assume the role of data controller with respect to the personal data processed thereby. Such parties bear sole responsibility for:

<ol type="i">
    <li>
        Ensuring compliance with all applicable data protection laws, including but not limited to GDPR;
    </li>
    <li>
        Providing appropriate disclosures in their own privacy policies;
    </li>
    <li>
        Establishing a lawful basis for processing under GDPR Article 6(1); and
    </li>
    <li>
        Fulfilling all obligations imposed upon data controllers under applicable law.
    </li>
</ol>

The privacy policy of Fonticons, Inc. is accessible at [https://fontawesome.com/privacy](https://fontawesome.com/privacy). Implementation of Font Awesome Pro or Pro+ features subjects the implementing party to Font Awesome’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

### Code of Conduct violation reports

To maintain a safe and respectful community, the Website operator processes data submitted voluntarily for Code of Conduct (CoC) violation reports.

| Data processing activity | Lawful basis (Art. 6)                                          | Special Category Basis (Art. 9)                                                      | Data processor |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------- |
| CoC report processing    | Legitimate interest: Community safety, security and integrity. | Necessity for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims (Art. 9(2)(f)). | Tally          |

**Data processed:**

- **Identifying information:** Contact details of the reporter (if provided) and identifiers of the reported individual(s) (e.g., username, account ID).
- **Incident details:** Textual data, time stamps and any attached screenshots describing the alleged violation, which may contain sensitive personal data (special category data).

**Safeguards:**

The processing relies on strict data minimisation and confidentiality measures. Access to reports is strictly limited to essential team members required for investigation. The data is retained only for the duration necessary to complete the investigation and enforce remedial action. The Website operator maintains a mandatory Data Processing Agreement (DPA) with Tally.

### Local storage implementation

The Website utilises the browser’s `localStorage` API for the sole purpose of storing user‐specific preferences on the client‐side device. This data is exclusively non‐personal and is not transmitted to our servers. Such data may encompass configuration settings, such as theme preferences (e.g., light/dark mode) and the state of user interface elements (e.g., sidebar visibility). This practice is undertaken to enhance user experience by persisting settings between sessions.

### Third‐party analytics

For the purpose of website performance monitoring and optimisation, the Website employs Cabin Analytics. This third‐party service is a privacy‐first analytics solution that collects and processes only anonymised, aggregated and non‐personal data. The data collected includes, but is not limited to, page view counts, referral sources and general device/browser information. This data is processed in a manner that precludes the identification of data subjects and is not linked to any individual user. The Website operator relies on the processor’s policy and technical implementation of anonymisation by design to classify this activity as non‐personal data processing. The privacy policy of Cabin Analytics is accessible at [https://docs.withcabin.com/privacy](https://docs.withcabin.com/privacy).

## Legal provisions

### Compliance with GDPR

The processing activities herein described are designed to be in full compliance with the GDPR. Placer Toolkit is the Data Controller responsible for determining the purposes and means of processing personal data.

| Data controller status                 | Data processor relationships                                                                                                                                |
| :------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Placer Toolkit is the data controller. | We maintain a mandatory DPA with Netlify (hosting and content delivery).                                                                                    |
|                                        | We maintain a mandatory DPA with Tally (CoC reports).                                                                                                       |
|                                        | Other external service providers (jsDelivr, Bunny Fonts, Cabin Analytics) are generally not considered our data processors for the purposes of this Policy. |

### International data transfers

The processing of technical data, specifically IP addresses, involves transfers to processors located in the United States of America, notably Netlify, Inc. As a legal basis for these transfers of personal data from the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK) to a U.S.‐based processor, the Website operator relies on the processor’s adherence to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (DPF). This framework ensures an adequate level of data protection in compliance with Chapter V of the GDPR and the applicable UK data protection regime.

### Policy amendments

This Policy may be amended from time to time. Any such modifications shall be posted on this page, and the “Effective date” will be updated accordingly. Continued use of the Website following such amendments shall constitute acceptance of the revised Policy.
