This utility hides undefined custom elements until they are registered.

Often, components are shown before their logic and styles have had a chance to load, also known as a Flash of Undefined Custom Elements (FOUCE).

The Reduce FOUCE style utility (which is automatically applied if you import `placer.css`) automatically takes care of hiding custom elements until **both they and their contents** have been registered, up to a maximum of two seconds.

In many cases, this is not enough, and you may wish to hide a broader wrapper element or even the entire page until all Placer Toolkit elements within it have loaded. To do that, you can add the `pc-cloak` class to any element on the page or even apply it to the whole page by placing the class on the HTML element.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html class="pc-cloak">
    <head>
        <!-- … -->
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- … -->
    </body>
</html>
```
