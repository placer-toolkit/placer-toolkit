Badges are used to draw attention and display statuses or counts.

<CodeDemo open>
{`<pc-badge>Badge</pc-badge>`}
</CodeDemo>

## Demos

### Appearances

Set the `appearance` attribute to change the badge’s appearance.

<CodeDemo>
{`<pc-badge appearance="primary">Primary</pc-badge>
<pc-badge appearance="success">Success</pc-badge>
<pc-badge appearance="neutral">Neutral</pc-badge>
<pc-badge appearance="warning">Warning</pc-badge>
<pc-badge appearance="danger">Danger</pc-badge>`}
</CodeDemo>

### Rounded badges

Use the `rounded` attribute to give the badge a rounded rectangle shape.

<CodeDemo>
{`<pc-badge appearance="primary" rounded>Primary</pc-badge>
<pc-badge appearance="success" rounded>Success</pc-badge>
<pc-badge appearance="neutral" rounded>Neutral</pc-badge>
<pc-badge appearance="warning" rounded>Warning</pc-badge>
<pc-badge appearance="danger" rounded>Danger</pc-badge>`}
</CodeDemo>

### Pulsating badges

Use the `pulse` attribute to draw attention to the badge with a subtle animation.

<CodeDemo>
{`<div class="badge-pulse">
    <pc-badge appearance="primary" pulse>1</pc-badge>
    <pc-badge appearance="success" pulse>1</pc-badge>
    <pc-badge appearance="neutral" pulse>1</pc-badge>
    <pc-badge appearance="warning" pulse>1</pc-badge>
    <pc-badge appearance="danger" pulse>1</pc-badge>
</div>

<style>
    .badge-pulse pc-badge:not(:last-of-type) {
        margin-right: var(--pc-spacing-l);
    }
</style>`}
</CodeDemo>

### With menu items

When including badges in menu items, use the `suffix` slot to make sure they’re aligned correctly.

<CodeDemo>
{`<pc-menu style="max-width: 240px">
    <pc-menu-label>Messages</pc-menu-label>
    <pc-menu-item>
        Comments
        <pc-badge slot="suffix">4</pc-badge>
    </pc-menu-item>
    <pc-menu-item>
        Replies
        <pc-badge slot="suffix">12</pc-badge>
    </pc-menu-item>
</pc-menu>`}
</CodeDemo>
